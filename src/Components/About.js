         <h1>“My job is to document memories of your most meaningful life events. 
         My vision is to capture the little moments in between. Each image has the opportunity to
          tell a story and my mission is to present you with images that are timeless, which speak for

    <h2>Creativity</h2> 
     
    <h3>After viewing a product or meeting a client, Melinda Pike has a keen ability to see a larger 
         picture and bring the product or subject being photographed to life. Melinda uses each image to
          tell a story and has successfully done so with hundreds of clients.</h3>
     
     <h2>Equipment and Presentation</h2>
     
    <h3>Being prepared is one of the most important things a photographer can do prior to a shoot. 
     Once Melinda is booked for your session, she will create a list of shots called a “shot list” which will
      be delivered to the client. Melinda then decides what equipment and lenses are appropriate for the shoot.
       The images are delivered via high-resolution disk or DropBox/GoogleDrive, depending on the clients needs.</h3> 
     
     <h2>Experience</h2>
     
     <h3>Melinda Pike has officially been in business for five years. Something that makes Melinda unique is that 
     she stays booked, year round! When Melinda isn’t booked shooting weddings, portraits, or commercial photos, 
     she is seeking opportunities to better her work. Melinda has the experience and the eye to produce results her
      clients love whether capturing newborn photos or shooting a lifestyle catalog for a large brand.</h3>
     
    <h2>Business Knowledge</h2>
     
     <h3>Melinda received her Bachelors degree, with honors and participated in a variety of business clubs. 
     She was selected to travel and present on behalf of her University with a team of 5 other students.
      Prior to receiving her bachelors, she had over eight years of marketing and social media marketing
       experience. This business knowledge has helped Melinda to maintain hundreds of professional relationships. 
       Today Melinda brings 12 years of experience to the Digital Marketing, PR and Photography industries!</h3>
